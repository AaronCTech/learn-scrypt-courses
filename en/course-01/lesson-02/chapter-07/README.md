# Chapter 7: Summary

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the interaction between the front-end page and the smart contract. You already have the basic skills to develop dApp. You're awesome!

Through these two lessons, we will show you the core content of smart contract development and interaction with smart contracts. If you are interested, you can continue to improve on the basis of this Tic Tac Toe dApp. for example:

1. Build a back-end service for it to support different players to play against
2. Now the **UTXO** of the contract is managed on the front-end page, and put it in the back-end management
3. Access more wallets
4. Increase the grid, such as 5X5
5. Use other contract rules to implement, such as `nSequence`


Looking forward to you building a surprising dApp
