# Chapter 11: Checking the preimage and accessing the transaction context

## Bitcoin signature verification

`OP_CHECKSIG` is the operation code for Bitcoin signature to verify [ECDSA signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm). In theory, it includes two steps:


1. Calculate a hash value based on the current transaction.
2. Perform signature verification on this hash value.

## Preimage

The preimage of the transaction is not the complete current transaction data, but the preimage generated by the complete current transaction. Bitcoin's signature is actually to sign the hash of the preimage of the transaction.

[Preimage format](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv/blob/master/doc/abc/replay-protected-sighash.md#digest-algorithm) is as follows:

## Check Preimage

sCrypt implements the [OP_PUSH_TX](https://xiaohuiliu.medium.com/op-push-tx-3d3d279174c1) algorithm, and encapsulates it into the standard contract function `Tx.checkPreimage` for calibration Check whether the incoming parameter is the prepicture of the current transaction.

```solidity
contract OP_PUSH_TX {
    public function unlock(SigHashPreimage preimage) { 
        require(Tx.checkPreimage(preimage));
    }
}
```


## Accessing the Transaction Context

Use `Tx.checkPreimage` to ensure that the preimage is the preimage of the current transaction. Since the preimage contains transaction-related data, it is possible to access the context of the current transaction by accessing various fields in the preimage, such as accessing the `nLocktime` of the current transaction.

```solidity
static function nLocktimeRaw(SigHashPreimage txPreimage) : bytes {
    int l = len(txPreimage);
    return txPreimage[l - 8 : l - 4];
}

```

Access to the locking script of the contract called by the current transaction `scriptCode`

```solidity
static function scriptCode(SigHashPreimage txPreimage) : bytes {
    return Util.readVarint(txPreimage[104 : ]);
}

```


## Put it to the Test

The `TicTacToe` contract is a stateful contract. The public function `move` is continuously called through the transaction to trigger the execution of the contract, thereby updating the state.
Therefore, **OP_PUSH_TX** technology must be used to maintain the state of the contract.

1. Check if the last parameter `txPreimage` of the `move` function is the preimage of the current transaction.

2. Use the preimage to read the contract that is called by the current transaction to locking script `scriptCode`
