# Chapter 1: Course overview

Through this course, you will learn how to use sCrypt to build a Tic-Tac-Toe dApp on Bitcoin.

The application is very simple. What it does is use the public key hashes of two players (Alice and Bob respectively) to initialize the contract, and each bet the same amount and lock it into the contract. Only the one who wins can take the contract. If no one wins the money inside, the two players can each withdraw half of the money.

We will gradually complete the building of the app, including:

1. Write a contract
2. App front-end integration contract
