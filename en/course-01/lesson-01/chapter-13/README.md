# Chapter 13: Stateful Contract

One of the most challenging parts for sCrypt beginners is to keep internal state in a contract. We provide an elegant solution using state decorators.

## The Problem


For instance, in the counter contract in the previous chapter, we maintain a state, counter, and increase it by one every time increment() is called. We only maintain a counter here and there is already tons of boilerplate code, mostly to serialize and deserialize the state (Line 5â€“9 and Line 15). The core logic is just one line at Line 12. Code grows more cumbersome and error-prone when the state becomes more complex.


## The Solution: State Decorators

With the new state decorator approach, you can maintain state in a contract with three simple steps, as shown below:

1. Declare any property that is part of the state with a decorator `@state`.
2. Use the stateful property as a normal property: read and update it.
3. When you are ready to pass the state onto the `output[s]` in the spending transaction, simply call a built-in function `this.getStateScript()` (Line 11), automatically generated for every contract.


```
contract Counter {
    @state
    int counter;
    
    public function mutate(SigHashPreimage txPreimage, int amount) {
        require(Tx.checkPreimage(txPreimage));
   
        // mutate state
        this.counter++;

        bytes outputScript = this.getStateScript();

        bytes output = Util.buildOutput(outputScript, amount);
        require(hash256(output) == Util.hashOutputs(txPreimage));
    }
}
```

As you can see, this is more concise and secure than manually serializing and deserializing state. The advantage is more significant when the state grows.

## Put it to the test

Use `@state` decoration to add the following state to the `TicTacToe` contract.

1. Add state property `is_alice_turn`, type `bool`; Add state property `board`, type `bytes`
2. Update state property
